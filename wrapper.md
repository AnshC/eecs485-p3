# Project 3 Wrapper

### Q1: What advice would you give future students about debugging React components? {: #Q1}

I would tell them to go to the React Docs to understand how components render and what errors could possibly be thrown if handled incorrectly. Furthermore stack overflow is a great resource to help debug errors like this.

Q2a: How did your team design your React components to handle dynamic updates such as likes and comments?
Q2b: How did your team pass data between React components?

### Answer at least one of the two questions above {: #Q2}

I handled passing data in between react components using props and the react state functionality. I passed props into individual Post components, and used state functionality to dynamically update data across a component.

### Q3: How did your team approach the division of work for this project? How did that experience go? {: #Q3}

I worked alone for this project, and effectively divided this project into 2 major chunks (rest api and client side). I worked on the REST API early, and started the client side later on (towards the end of the project).
